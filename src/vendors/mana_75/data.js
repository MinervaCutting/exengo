    ` The <strong>Mana 75</strong> is another option for your group to enjoy
    the beach. Located next to the <strong>W</strong> Hotel, next to the
    Marina Yacht Club - which is the most luxurious Yacht Marina in the
    Mediterranean, and very close to where the futuristic
    <strong>Barcelona's Hermitage Museum </strong> will be located.`,

    ` The restaurant boasts modern design, and open 20-meter kitchen, in
    which you can see how your food is cooked at all times.`,

    `Their specialty is anything fish-related. A typical meal at Mana 75
    starts with some pica-pica (tomato spread bread, squid rings, razor
    clams, ....), followed by a seafood paella, or some seabass, and
    ending with a delicious dessert. The restaurant serves top quality
    food with amazing and fast service.`,
