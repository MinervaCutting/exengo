    ` Our <strong>Tapas Tour</strong> combines a gastronomic experience, with
    a guided walking tour of the city's Old Town. This tour can also run in
    the more <strong>Art-nouveau area</strong> of Passeig de Gr√†cia, if
    preferred by the clients.`,

    ` <strong>CUTT/events</strong> work with a selection of the best guides in
    Barcelona. By law, every tour needs to include a licensed local guide -
    and we simply have the best ones in town, equally entertaining, funny
    and informative.`,

    ` Our guide walks the group around the Old Town , and stop en-route to
    comment some of the monuments and hidden corners, as well as some
    gastro-bars to taste traditional tapas alongside with drinks.`,

    ` On the gastronomic front, the tour typically includes 2 or 3 stops for
    tapas in different parts of town, and it takes around 3.5 hours to
    complete.`,
