    `   Through this spectacular, original and generating laughter treasure hunt (Gymkhana) they will get to know the city while we generate team spirit. During the briefing, the group will be split into teams (normally 5 people per team) and we will invite participants to become urban explorers. Each of the teams will be given a backpack with an "explorer kit" which shall consist of: Booklet where you will find questions and challenges , a map, a compass, a Nikon camera, a GPS, pedometers and binoculars. Through this scavenger hunt quiz type full of questions, tracks and challenges, they will have to discover curious places in the city, find things which are difficult to find, interact with local people, make some funny pictures against the city landmarks, pass tests of all types and follow directions to the final point to get there as soon as possible and no later than the end time marked by the event organizer and master of ceremonies. They will discover landmarks of the city such as the Town Hall (medieval castle), the rectory, the Municipal Historical Archive, Palau Maricel, the Library Santiago Rusinyol and many more.`,
