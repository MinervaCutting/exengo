    `  <strong>Nuria</strong> opened its doors back in 1926, and it was
    inspired by some of the most romantic Parisian restaurants back then.
    People often think that <em>Nuria</em> must be the name of the owner,
    but it is not. Nuria references the catalan
    <strong>Nuria Valley</strong> in the Pyrenees, and the owners loved
    the valley, and they thought that Nuria was a good name for a
    restaurant`,

    ` During the 50's the place became a meeting point for artists that
    performed in Les Rambles theaters, and had their coffee, or chocolate
    with <em>xurros</em> at Nuria. Some very famous writers and artists
    were regular clients.`,

    `Today, the restaurant has undergone massive restoration, and it is a
    lively and cozy spot in the top part of Les Rambles. They specialize
    in traditional catalan cuisine, and in tapas - with great andalusian
    fried squid, or the delicious ham croquettes as some of their
    specialties.`,
