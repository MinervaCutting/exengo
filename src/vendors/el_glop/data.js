    5 minutes off Plaça Catalunya.`,

    is traditional catalan cuisine. Since most of the programme has been
    focused on tapas , paella and fish dishes, we think that this would be
    a good spot to have some grilled meat, which is something they are
    strong at - thus the name of <em>Brasserie</em>`,
