    `  Trekking or hiking is a noncompetitive activity to practice in a natural environment such as valleys, mountains, rivers or lakes. In this activity participants will learn the main keys and hiking trails with a qualified mountain guide. They will have professional equipment, such as canes and guidance tools such as maps and GPS. Its aim is to complete one of the marked trails, which you previously decided according to the time available and the desired degree of difficulty, enjoying the scenery, while the conversation and camaraderie among all is encouraged. This activity will not compete or assess any results in the end, it is a purely educational and cultural activity that will improve the sense of togetherness and companionship among the participants.`,

    `  <strong>Parque Natural del Garraf </strong> Almost all the massif is made up of limestone which, through contact with water and air, has given rise to the formation of carstic features: caves, potholes, sinkholes and fissures.
    Much of the Garraf presents a Southern Mediterranean landscape. The typical vegetation is dense shrubland of from one to three metres in height, dominated by Kermes oak and mastic, and also home to the Mediterranean fan palm, rope grass and other species originating from Africa.
